# Git Tools

Simple tool to open Git Gui, Gitk and Git Blame in Atom.

It runs on Linux and can run on OS X.
(Seems also to run on Windows 10 without problems).

Requires you to install
   - [git-gui](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-gui),
   - [gitk](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitk) and
   - [git-blame](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-blame)
